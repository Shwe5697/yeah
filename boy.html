<p>This video of yours always is the best one to change my mood!!!!</p>
<p class"i"> I cnt explain why I need u or why I wan to be with you. You were always with me in every situation.Bond we share is something diffrnt💞💞.A feeling wich I can never express.an emotional attachment towards you is never going to go out of my brain. Everytime m happy sad excited let it be any situation ur the one to whom I alwys wan to share my things.It takes years for me to get close to people but the only person I got close within days was you.🍁I share things I blabber shit I speak out I burst out only in front of u. I know u can't share something with me because I care for u it's okay ..there are times where I stop myself from sharing things but end up by saying each and everything...</p><p>Every moment u have encouraged me no doubt m ur dum girl but yeah when it comes to loving u...theres no one who cn reach me...always love u and let me be a part of ur life atleast till m alive ..ur lil girl might disappoint u but will never leave u ...U mean a lot to me.Encouraging me to fight towards whatever the situation is and to overcome it was always taught by you.Every mode il find many people but you'll always remain the special one and always the constant no matter what it is.I always love u ❤️❤️❤️</p>
